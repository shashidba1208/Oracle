Fix ORA-00257: archiver error in Oracle
ORA-00257:archiver error occurs when your archive log reached the FRA limit. So you have to clear the archive logs or you may increase the FRA limit.

To clear the archive logs files from the FAR location to solve this error ORA-00257:

Firstly you can empty the location with the following commands:

rman target /
-- First take backup of archive log to different location
RMAN> backup format '/archive/%d_%s_%p_%c.arc.bkp' archivelog from sequence 1000 until sequence 1050;
-- If you delete manually archive from drive then need to run crosscheck 
RMAN> crosscheck archivelog all;
-- Delete tha archivelog present on FAR location
RMAN> delete archivelog all;

-- If you want to remove expired archive log only:
rman target sys/put_sys_password_here
RMAN> crosscheck archivelog all;
RMAN> delete noprompt expired archivelog all;

Secondly, Verify the location and change the archive log dest parameter to move the archive to a different location

Verify the location used by Archive:

archive log list

SQL> archive log list
Database log mode          	Archive Mode
Automatic archival         	Enabled
Archive destination        	USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST
Oldest online log sequence 	90
Next log sequence to archive    92
Current log sequence       	92

OR

show parameter db_recovery_file_dest;
Check the utilization of the space which cause this error:

SELECT * FROM V$RECOVERY_FILE_DEST;
Move the archive to a different location will fix the issue also:

alter system set log_archive_dest_1='LOCATION=/u03/arch' scope=both;

select destination,STATUS from v$archive_dest where statuS='VALID';
